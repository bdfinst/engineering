We do this by focusing on very frequent small batches of high quality delivery.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Change frequency is important to make sure that waste is driven out of the process. This reduces costs, improves the\nsustainability of flow, and ensures there is a verified quality process for emergency changes.</li>\n<li>Small batches are easier to inspect for quality and limit the impact of any quality issues.</li>\n<li>Change success is an important offsetting metric. If we only focus on change size and change frequency,\nquality will suffer. If we only focus on reducing the number of defects and eliminating impacting changes, batch size\nand frequency suffer. The data shows that this actually results in more defects and more costs.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Throughput</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"./development-cycle-time.html\">Development Cycle Time</a>: Time from when a task is started until it is \"Done\".

If code is not continuously integrating, it cannot\nbe safely delivered.</p>\n<p>The focus of CI is to amplify quality feedback. The more frequently code is integrated and tested, the sooner any\nquality issues will be found and the smaller those issues will be.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"./integration-frequency.html\">Integration Frequency</a>: Frequency of code integrating to the trunk. KPI for efficacy of\nrefining requirements, quality process, and teamwork.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a team is mob programming, this should occur several times a day.</li>\n<li>When a team is pair programming, this should occur several times a day per pair.</li>\n<li>When the team is working on individual tasks, this should occur several times a day per developer.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"./build-duration.html\">Build Cycle Time</a>: Time from commit to production deploy. KPI for the stability of the\npipeline and efficiency of the quality process. Long build cycle times have a direct negative impact on MTTR, and\nbatch size. This encourages abandoning defined quality checks in emergency situations making emergency changes the\nriskiest changes to make.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"workflow-management\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#workflow-management\" aria-label=\"workflow management permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Workflow Management</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"./velocity.html\">Velocity / Throughput</a>: Planning metric to allow the team to predict date ranges for delivery.
