## Organizational Metrics

These metrics are important for teams and management to track the health of the delivery system

## Team Metrics

These metrics should only be used by teams to inform decision making. They are ineffective for measuring quality, productivity, or
delivery system health.

| Metric                                 | Source          | Meaning                                                                                          | Goal of Measuring                                                                                                              | Issues with Metric                                                                                                                                  |

Find code that should be better tested                                          | When coverage goals are set, can generate tests that meet the goals but are ineffective as tests.                                                   |
| [Velocity/Throughput](./velocity.html) | Jira            | The number of story points (Velocity) or tasks (Throughput) completed during a increment of time | Allow planning for the future based on the relative complexity of pending work compared to what has been previously delivered. | When used as a performance metric instead of as a planning metric, it ceases to have value for planning and give a false indication of performance. |
