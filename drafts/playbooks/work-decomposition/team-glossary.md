# {{ page.title }}

A glossary documents the agreed upon language used by the business for this
specific business domain. Using the glossary, all artifacts will use the same
word to mean the same thing in stories, code, tests, and data properties.

## Recommended Practices

Team glossaries should document the critical language specific to the team. For
product clarity and ease of communication with all stakeholders, every word that
is specific to the team's product context should have exactly one definition.

### Tips

- Version the glossary and make sure to reference it frequently.
- Make sure the terms are agreed to by all stakeholders.
- Always have a 1:1 relationship between word and meaning.

---

## Value

As a product team member, I want to know what terms to use in communication as
well as in code and data structures so that we can minimize confusion and
defects when implementing changes.

### Acceptance Criteria

- One word for a meaning.
- One meaning for a word.
- Glossary is posted publicly.
- Glossary is versioned.
- Updates are made as soon as new terms enter the domain specific language of the product.
