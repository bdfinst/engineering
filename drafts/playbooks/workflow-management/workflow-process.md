Workflow management is the processes we use to move things from started to done,
as rapidly as possible in value sequence.

## Workflow Management Process

In order to streamline business tasks, minimize room for error, and increase
overall efficiency, teams need to have the following prerequisites.

- [Definition of Done](./definition-of-done.html)
- [Kanban Board](./visualizing-workflow.html), virtual or physical, with a
  prioritized backlog

---

### Plan Work

Unplanned work is _anything_ coming into the backlog that has not been committed
to, or prioritized. This can incdlue feature requests, support tickets, etc.

Common struggles teams face with unplanned work can be:

- [Work that has not been prioritized](./unplanned-work.html)
- [Work that has not been decomposed](./../work-decomposition/work-breakdown.html)
- [Work that is unplanned](./unplanned-work.html)

---

### Do Work

Completed work meets the [Definition of Ready](./../work-decomposition/definition-of-ready.html)
when work begins, the [Definition of Done](./definition-of-done.html) when work
is delivered, and can be completed in less than two days.

Process smells identified for completing work include:

- [Context switching](./team-dynamics.html)
- [Ineffective demoes, or lack thereof](./feedback-loops.html)
- [Multiple teams owning pieces of the process](./team-dynamics.html)
- [Status and visibility of work is unclear](./visualizing-workflow.html)
- [Siloed work](./team-dynamics.html)

---

### Improve Work

In order to plan and complete work effectively, there must be [an improvement
process](../delivery-system-improvement-journey.html#3-continuous-improvement) in place. The improvement process is centered around feedback loops.

Challenges associated with the improvement process:

- [Infrequent or nonexistent demoes](./feedback-loops.html)
- [Infrequent and unactionable retrospectives](./../retrospective-playbook.html)

---

### Measuring Your Workflow

A good measure to implement in your team's workflow is [WIP](./limiting-wip.html).
Limiting work in progress can help reduce constraints in your workflow.

[Development cycle time](./../../metrics/development-cycle-time.html) is a key
measure of success when trying to optimize and automate your team's workflow.
