Team dynamics in relation to the workflow process is important in value delivery.
A fully cross-functional product team is critical to the health of the application,
and everyone on the team should take responsibility of the workflow process.

Below are common struggles we know teams to have.

---

### Context Switching

Context switching kills productivity. It takes time and effort to get into
focus, so switching between two tasks can waste time and energy.

Focusing on more than one task or project at a time can introduce human overhead and
technical debt.

Utilize WIP limits to keep context switching to a minimum.

---

### Siloed Work

Silos occur when individuals, teams, or even departments cannot, or will not,
share adequate information with one another. When work is siloed, the flow of
information and collaboration decrease. This leads to unknown dependencies,
workflow issues, and duplicated efforts.

In order to overcome silos, teams should hold themselves accountable, and others,
to making work visible. Utilizing a standard communication and collaboration process
can also be effective.

---

### Process Ownership

Multiple teams owning pieces of the workflow process can create bottlenecks to
value delivery. When teams separate development from testing, for example, it creates
unnecessary handoffs and increases time to delivery.

In order to support products effectively, teams need to own the entire workflow
process, from intake to production. The "over-the-wall" approach reduces visibility
to the rest of the workflow process.

### Value

As a development team, we want to understand the pitfalls associated to team dynamics,
so that we may reduce bottlenecks and increase value delivery.
