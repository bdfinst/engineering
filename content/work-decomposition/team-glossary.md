A glossary documents the agreed upon language used by the business for this
specific business domain. Using the glossary, all artifacts will use the same
word to mean the same thing in stories, code, tests, and data properties.

## Recommended Practices

Team glossaries should document the critical language specific to the team. For
product clarity and ease of communication with all stakeholders, every word that
is specific to the team's product context should have exactly one definition.

### Tips

- Version the glossary and make sure to reference it frequently.
- Make sure the terms are agreed to by all stakeholders.
- Always have a 1:1 relationship between word and meaning.
